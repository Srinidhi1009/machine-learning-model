# Task 2: Machine Learning Model

## 📌 Description
Train and evaluate a **Decision Tree classifier** on the Iris dataset using Scikit-learn.

---

## 📖 Overview
Machine learning models allow us to make predictions based on data.  
In this task:  
- The **Iris dataset** is used (a classic dataset with flower measurements).  
- Features include sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.  
- A **Decision Tree Classifier** is trained to predict the flower species.  
- The model is evaluated using **accuracy score** on a test dataset.

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. Load the Iris dataset from Scikit-learn.  
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.  
3. Train a **Decision Tree Classifier**.  
4. Make predictions on test data.  
5. Evaluate model accuracy.  

## 📊 Expected Output

```
Accuracy: 1.0
```

*(The exact accuracy may vary depending on train/test split and parameters.)*

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

Install the required library:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Compare multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM).
* Perform hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.
* Visualize the decision tree structure.
* Evaluate with additional metrics (precision, recall, F1-score).
